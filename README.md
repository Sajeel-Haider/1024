"1024 Console Game" was my first semester project. After acquiring a solid foundation in C++ programming, I developed this project using the "windows.h" library to incorporate console-based graphics. I leveraged my understanding of arrays, including their updating and shifting mechanisms, which I acquired throughout my programming fundamentals course.
